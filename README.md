# Quality-Assurance-testing-on-MedClinic
🏥 MedClinic QA Testing Project

📘 Project Overview

The MedClinic QA Testing Project is a comprehensive Quality Assurance initiative aimed at validating the functionality, performance, security, and usability of the MedClinic healthcare application. This project includes thorough functional and non-functional testing, code reviews, black-box and white-box testing, unit tests, and performance/load testing using JMeter.

This document serves as a guide to the testing processes, deliverables, and documentation supporting the MedClinic application’s quality and stability across all modules.

⚠️ Risks and Assumptions

Identifies potential risks (e.g., late requirement changes, third-party system downtime) and assumptions (e.g., test environment parity with production).

🔍 Static Code Review

Function-by-function analysis of core logic:

Formatters and appointment filters
Doctor/patient data access
UI logic and rendering patterns
Includes:

Summary of detected issues
Best practices followed
Reviewer notes and recommendations
🎯 Test Cases

🔳 Black-Box Testing
Covers user-facing features with no knowledge of code internals.

Examples:

✅ Valid login and registration
❌ Missing credentials or unauthorized access
✅ Appointment viewing and filtering
❌ Missing/invalid doctor or patient data
✅ Report generation
⚪ White-Box Testing
Focuses on internal logic, control flow, and edge cases.

Examples:

Age calculation logic
Input state handling
Sorting, filtering, and condition-based rendering
Profile fetch and slot availability
🧪 Unit Testing

Implemented across key components
Validates internal methods for scheduling, profile retrieval, and user actions
Screenshots and code snippets included
Results summaries confirm pass/fail coverage
🤖 Automated Testing

Automated test scripts for:

Appointment slot validation
Status filtering
Profile data accuracy
UI interactivity testing
Ensures high coverage with reduced manual effort.

📈 Performance & Load Testing

Performed using Apache JMeter:

Simulated concurrent users and appointment requests
Captured response time, error rates, throughput
Key metrics and analysis included
🔁 Regression Testing

Re-tested previous test cases after updates
Ensured no new bugs introduced
Impact assessment documented
📊 Key Metrics Summary

Test Coverage: ~95%
Automated Test Execution: ~70%
Defects Found & Resolved: 100%
Critical Bugs in Production: 0
📝 Conclusion

The QA Testing Project for MedClinic has provided a robust verification of all system components. Through functional testing, static code analysis, unit validation, automation, and performance simulation, the application has been thoroughly evaluated for production readiness.
